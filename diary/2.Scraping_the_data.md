# Scraping the data

Current scrapping uses tags and css selectors. This probably is not a sustainable
way to do it. What I mean by that is that the websites might change and make the code
irrelevant. I wasn't able to find a free API.
  
In the future I would also prefer the whole scraper to be a class and use MPI or
other parallel method of scarping the data as currently is rather slow.

I have discovered that otodom actually provides all the data that is interesting
to me inside a nice json at the end of the html. So now I'll remake the code.

Remade the get_links function. Really happy with the discovery of that json.
Might change this diaries format later though.

I created a class that will crawl the website and obtain URLs to offers and
another one that will scrape the data from it. Now I want to add some tests. 
It will be helpful in the future as the codebase gets larger.
