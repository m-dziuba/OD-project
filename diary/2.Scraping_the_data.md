# Scraping
## 08/05/2022
Current scrapping uses tags and css selectors. This probably is not a sustainable
way to do it. What I mean by that is that the websites might change and make the code
irrelevant. I wasn't able to find a free API.
  
In the future I would also prefer the whole scraper to be a class and use MPI or
other parallel method of scarping the data as currently is rather slow.
