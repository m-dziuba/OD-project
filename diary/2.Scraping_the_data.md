# Scraping

Current scrapping uses tags and css selectors. This probably is not a sustainable
way to do it. What I mean by that is that the websites might change and make the code
irrelevant. I wasn't able to find a free API.
  
In the future I would also prefer the whole scraper to be a class and use MPI or
other parallel method of scarping the data as currently is rather slow.

I have discovered that otodom actually provides all the data that is interesting
to me inside a nice json at the end of the html. So now I'll remake the code.

### 22:15
Remade the get_links function. Really happy with the discovery of that json.
Might change this diaries format later though. Ending for today.
